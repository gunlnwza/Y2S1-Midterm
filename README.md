# Y2S1-Midterm

A cheatsheets repo for my friends.

**Disclaimer: Please take everything I say below with a grain of salt, and also do your own research. All lecturers have taught a lot of things in this semester: so there might be some topics on the test that I may forgot, choose to not include here, or just pure speculation.**

## Probability & Statistics (Maths but with a lot of counting)

The only tip I can give you guys here is to expose yourself to a lot of questions. So here are a lot of practice problems for you to do!

**Please try to do them by yourself first.** Only after fighting bravely for 10 minutes, may you look at the solution.

Note: Important concepts/tools/weapons (whatever you'd like to call them, I like to use all three interchangebly) will be explained before their respective questions.

## Linear Algebra (Maths about solving linear equations)

This will be in the same format as Prob & Stats. Explaination for concepts will be provided, and a lot of problems for you to practice on.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (Programming theories to prepare for an interview with Google)



## Numerical Methods (Calculus x Programming)
