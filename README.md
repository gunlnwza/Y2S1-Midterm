A cheatsheets repo for my friends.

## Probability & Statistics (Maths but with a lot of counting)
The only tip I can give you guys here is to expose yourself to a lot of questions. So here are a lot of practice problems for you to do! **Please try to do them by yourself first.** Only after fighting for 10 minutes, may you look at the solution.

Note: Important concepts/tools/weapons (whatever you'd like to call them) will be explained before their respective questions.

## Linear Algebra (Maths about solving linear equations)


## Data Structures & Algorithms (Programming theories to prepare for an interview with Google)

## Numerical Methods (Calculus x Programming)
